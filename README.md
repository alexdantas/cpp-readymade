# c++ readymade

[![emacs banner](http://badges.alexdantas.net/emacs.png)](http://badges.alexdantas.net/)

Reusable C++ code - classes that I've made along the way.

* Plug-and-play: No hassle, they only use standard C++ functions.
* Warning/Error-free: They were all tested with the latest GCC and `-Wall
  -Wextra` flags.
* Just use them: I don't even need credits (although it would be
  nice :D).

## Usage

Simply place the `.cpp/.hpp` files on your project and include them on your
`Makefile`.

## License

They're all licensed under the [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net).
See `LICENSE` file for more info.

## Credits

Just as a sidenote - if you ever use them, would you mind mailing me with your
project link? It's not a requirement - I'd just be glad to contribute!

All things programmed by Alexandre Dantas.
